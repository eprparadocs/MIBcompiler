Sorry world but I changed the MIB compiler software just before sending

it out. I tried to add a few more comments to it. As a result I was told

that I "fixed" something. As a result the following code in AssignOBJECT.c

is incorrect:

void ProcessObject(char *pName,TYPE *pSyntax,int Access,int Status,

> char *pDesc,char *pRef,LIST *pIndex,LIST *pDefault,

> LIST *pOID,int nLineNo,int bSaveOI

D)

> {

> LIST *pNew;

> /*

> * See if the OID supplied can be converted to only numbers, such as

> * 1.3.6

> */

> *pNew = ResolveSpecificOID(pOID,pName,0);

^

The statement *pNew = ResolveSpecificOID(), should be

pNew = ResolveSpecificOID(...)

Please forgive the mistake, I am humbled. Many thanks to the people

that found it and told me about it. I should always remember to not

fix anything which isn't broken!

A very humbled, Chuck Wegrzyn
